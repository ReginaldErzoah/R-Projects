# R-Projects
This is a collection of R projects

## 1. Weather Project for Beginners.
This is a simple R project to calculate and plot average yearly temperature using a dataset downloaded from kaggle.

Link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muthuj7/weather-dataset/data

The R code used (Beginner Weather Project) is also located in this repository.

## 2. E-Commerce Webpage A/B Testing 
This project compares the conversion rates of two groups (control and treatment) using A/B testing in R.
The data was imported from "ab_data.csv".

### Analysis Steps
1. Data Exploration
2. Calculate Conversion Rates
3. Visualize Conversion Rates
4. Chi-square Test
5. Interpretation of Results

### Results & Conclusion
- Conversion rate for control group: 12.0%
- Conversion rate for treatment group: 11.9%
- Chi-square test result: X-squared = 1.5193, p-value = 0.2177
- The X-squared value (1.5193) was not extremely high or low therefore there was no significant difference in both groups.
- The p-value (0.2177) which is >0.05 indicates that there's no significance in the conversion rates of the treatment and control groups.

### Recommendation
Maintain the current webpage (control) because switching to a new webpage (treatment) won't lead a significant increase in conversion rates.
