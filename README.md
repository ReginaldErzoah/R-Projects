## 1. E-Commerce Webpage AB Testing 
This project compares the conversion rates of two groups (control and treatment) using A/B testing in R.
The data was imported from "ab_data.csv".

### Analysis Steps
1. Data Exploration
2. Calculate Conversion Rates
3. Visualize Conversion Rates
4. Chi-square Test
5. Interpretation of Results

### Results & Conclusion
- Conversion rate for control group: 12.0%
- Conversion rate for treatment group: 11.9%
- Chi-square test result: X-squared = 1.5193, p-value = 0.2177
- The X-squared value (1.5193) was not extremely high or low therefore there was no significant difference in both groups.
- The p-value (0.2177) which is >0.05 indicates that there's no significance in the conversion rates of the treatment and control groups.
